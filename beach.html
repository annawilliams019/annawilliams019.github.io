<h1> BEACH</h1>
<h2> I love going to the beach! I have a family owned beach cottage right on Humarock Beach in Humarock, Massachusetts. The little town surrounding it has a few restaurants and shops. I spend the majority of my time here. It is a very serene, quiet, space for my entire family to enjoy.</h2>
<h3> Usually, I will have friends or other family members come visit. My closest friends love spending time on the beach. Although I am not as tan as the rest of my family, I always hang out and go tanning whenever I have time to do so.</h3>
