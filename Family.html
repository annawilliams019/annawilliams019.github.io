<h1> FAMILY </h1>
<h2> I am the oldest of 3 children in my immediate family. I have a younger sister, Lily, who is a sophomore in highschool. I also have a younger brother who is in eighth grade. Both of my parents are one of six children, so I have a lot of cousins on each side of my family. I have 19 cousins just on my mother's side of the family, and interesting enough, 16 of the 19 cousins are females.</h2>
<h3> I love to go on vacation with my family. I try to spend as much time with them as I can. However, it is difficult being away from them in college.</h3>
