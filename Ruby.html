<h1> RUBY </h1>
<h2> I have one dog, more of a puppy, named Ruby. She is a little over a year old and is the best part of my loud, and fun, family. Ruby is a chocolate lab. She is very jumpy and almost always excited. We recently sent her to 'Canine College' where she was trained to behave a bit better. She is doing a lot better now!</h2>
<h3> When my family first got Ruby, she was the size of my fist adn could barely run around because her stomach was too big and dragged along the ground.</h3>
